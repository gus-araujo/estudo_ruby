# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

#500.times do 
#    User.new(
#    name: Faker::Name.name,
#    email: Faker::Internet.email,
#    age: Faker::Number.between(10,70),
#    phone: Faker::PhoneNumber.cell_phone
